# AutoHandSimulator
A keyboard/mouse input to simulate movement and hand controls for the [AutoHand](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/physics/auto-hand-vr-physics-interaction-165323) package for Unity.

(Do you like the looks of it? - it's a work in progress. Follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/MTrobotics?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) , I will be sharing more about this game in the coming months :-) )

## Update! - Now includes basic hand control

![LegacyAutoHandSim](AutoHandSim_w_hands.gif) 

To control hands, simply hold down Q for left hand and E for right hand and move the mouse, to move the hands up/down/left/right and scroll to move forward/backwards.

# Setup
* Setup [AutoHand](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/physics/auto-hand-vr-physics-interaction-165323) for Unity.
* Copy `Assets` folder into your project
* Make sure `Mock HMD` is enabled: `Go to Edit -> Project Settings-> XR Plug-in Management -> Mock HMD Loader`
* Attach the `Assets/AutoHand/Scripts/DebugTools/AutoHandPlayerControllerInputSimulator.cs` to the **AutoHandPlayer**.

* If using unity version **2021.2.12f1**, make sure to enable the old input handler: `Go to Edit` -> `Project Settings` -> `Player` -> Under `Other Settings` under `Configuration` is the option `Active Input Handling`. Select `Both`.

The script should(!) detect whether the Mock HMD is used and only be effective, if that is the case. 
If that is **NOT** the case, the code will simply not run. 
Also, it is using pre-processor directives, so it won't compile for build versions, i.e. you should be able to just leave it there, even for a build version.

## Prerequisites
Requires: 
* The Mock HMD from unity, get it here: https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.mock-hmd@1.0/manual/index.html
* The "old" input system from unity, which is the default for Autohand (AFAIK).
* The [AutoHand](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/physics/auto-hand-vr-physics-interaction-165323) package

## Known issues
- In the Demo scene locomotion using the script occasionally does not work. I have not been able to reliably repreoduce the problem - a restart of Unity usually fixes it.
- The raytracing of the hands when moving the hands is a little bit off, just because the screen is split in two in VR. You have to get used to it.

## Controls
Controls can be rebound to different key-bindings

- W,A,S,D -> Body movement
- HOLD Q-> Left hand movement
- HOLD E -> Right hand movement
- HOLD E + Q -> Both hands movement
- R -> Reset hands to default position
- HOLD Q + LMB -> grab with left
- HOLD E + LMB -> grab with right
- HOLD Q + HOLD E + LMB -> grab with both hands

- ESC -> Once play testing, click inside the game view to lock your cursor to the game.
         Escape can be used to detach the cursor from the game window

The camera behaves just like a first person shooter. When moving the mouse the camera freezes and stays in position.
